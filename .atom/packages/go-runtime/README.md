# go-runtime â€“ Detects and Configures Go Once For All Go Packages (DRY)

Detects and allows configuration of installed go runtime(s). This package provides a service for other packages that work with the `go` tool, other related tools (e.g. `gofmt`, `vet`, etc.) or `$GOPATH/bin` tools (e.g. `goimports`, `goreturns`, etc.).
